#I Want...

### Overview

This is an application I developed with four other developers. This application is targeted towards bored millenials that want to burn some time by watching, reading, or listening to any subject matter of their choice. The user simply chooses from one of the three aforementioned verbs and a noun (which the user can choose from a default set of nouns or input any noun of his or her choice) and click the now button. The user can also choose to click random and a random noun and verb will be chosen.
